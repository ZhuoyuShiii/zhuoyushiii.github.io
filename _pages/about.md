I am a PhD student in computer science at University of Southern California, advised by Prof. [Fred Morstatter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u-8h3HcAAAAJ&hl=en). I use computational methods and social media data to understand social behavior, especially how people use and influenced by causal language.
